To test the GPIO and the motor, use the [Raspbery_GPIO code](https://github.com/moozer/Raspberry_GPIO)

1. Pull the code

    > git clone https://github.com/moozer/Raspberry_GPIO.git
    > cd Raspberry_GPIO

2. Check the GPIO layout of your raspberry
    See [here](/raspberry)

3. Test the pins
    There are three test programs: `togglePin.py`, `readPin.py` and `runMotor.py`.
    See the [readme file](https://github.com/moozer/Raspberry_GPIO/blob/master/readme.md) for details.
